# RSS Decks

A Chrome extension for organizing multiple RSS/Atom feeds into blocks. View articles in the extension or play audio enclosures, such as podcasts.

## Installation

### Run in a development environment

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. Install the dependencies.
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Build for the Chromium target.
   ```sh
   yarn run build
   ```
4. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
5. Enable **Developer mode**.
6. Select **Load unpacked** and choose the generated `.output/chrome-mv3` folder.
7. Open RSS Decks by clicking its toolbar icon.

## Usage

- Select **Add** to register an RSS/Atom feed or a shortcut to a website.
- Use **Groups** to organize feeds, then drag them to reorder.
- Select an article in a feed to display it in the article pane by default. It opens in a new tab if the article pane is disabled or if you select the button to open it in a new tab.
- For articles with audio enclosures, select the play button to play the audio.
- Select **Refresh** to fetch feeds again. Up to 15 articles are shown for each feed.
- Use the checkboxes at the top of the page to toggle thumbnails and the article pane.
- Use the language menu at the top of the page to switch between Japanese and English. The choice is saved in the browser and defaults to the browser language.
- Use **Settings** to export or import shortcuts, groups, and feeds as JSON. Importing replaces all three types of settings.

Feeds, groups, shortcuts, and display preferences are stored in `chrome.storage.sync` and are subject to Chrome sync. If no feeds have been saved yet, the default feeds from Zenn, Qiita, and Yahoo! News are displayed.

## Permissions and privacy

- `storage`: Saves settings to Chrome sync storage.
- `declarativeNetRequest`: Removes the `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` response headers only for subframes loaded by the extension itself, so articles can be displayed in the extension's article pane.
- Optional host access (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`): Not granted at install. Chrome asks for access to each site's origin when you add or import a feed, refresh, or open an article, so feeds can be fetched and articles displayed. Denying it only affects that site.

Feed content and linked pages are retrieved from external websites. Review the URLs you register and the content of articles displayed in embedded views.
